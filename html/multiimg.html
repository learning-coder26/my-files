        SOIL PREPARATION
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Bedrock of Growth: Optimising soil for planting.

        Key Process: Soil preparation is crucial in the Modern Farming Ecosystem. 
        This involves testing the soil for nutrient content and pH levels and then amending it as needed.
         Techniques like ploughing or tilling are employed to prepare the land for sowing.

      <h2>STAGE 2</h2>
      <p>Beginning of the Lifecycle: Planting the seeds.

Key Process: The choice of sowing method (manual or mechanical) largely depends on the crop type and scale of the farm. Precision agriculture techniques are increasingly used to ensure optimal spacing and depth for the seeds, enhancing growth prospects.

        Nurturing the Crops: Providing water and nutrients.

       Key Process: Efficient irrigation systems are vital in the Modern Farming Ecosystem, especially in regions with unpredictable rainfall. Alongside, appropriate fertilization (organic or synthetic) ensures that crops receive essential nutrients for growth.
       ProtectIng the Crops: Managing threats to crop health.
       Key Process: Integrated pest management strategies, including the use of biocontrol agents and crop rotation, help manage pests and diseases with minimal ecological impact. This step is vital to safeguard crop yields and quality.

      <p>
        Reaping the Rewards: Gathering mature crops.
        
        Key Process: The timing of the harvest is critical and is often determined by monitoring crop maturity. Modern machinery facilitates efficient harvesting, especially for large-scale farms.
        
        Final Stage in the Farm: Preparing crops for the market.
        
        Key Process: This includes cleaning, sorting, packaging, and storing the produce. Post-harvest handling is crucial for maintaining the quality of the crop until it reaches the consumer.
