      <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
      <p>
        Ambedkar was born on 14 April 1891 in the town and military cantonment of Mhow (now officially known as Dr Ambedkar Nagar) 
        <br>(now in Madhya Pradesh).[3] He was the 14th and last child of Ramji Maloji Sakpal, an army officer who held the rank of 
        <br>Subedar, and Bhimabai Sakpal, daughter of Laxman Murbadkar.[4] His family was of Marathi background from the town of Ambadawe
         <br>(Mandangad taluka) in Ratnagiri district of modern-day Maharashtra. Ambedkar was born into a Mahar (dalit) caste, who were 
         <br>treated as untouchables and subjected to socio-economic discrimination.[5] Ambedkar's ancestors had long worked for the army 
        <br> of the British East India Company, and his father served in the British Indian Army at the Mhow cantonment.[6] Although they 
         <br>attended school, Ambedkar and other untouchable children were segregated and given little attention or help by teachers. 
         <br>They were not allowed to sit inside the class. When they needed to drink water, someone from a higher caste had to pour that 
         <br>water from a height as they were not allowed to touch either the water or the vessel that contained it. This task was usually
         <br> performed for the young Ambedkar by the school peon, and if the peon was not available then he had to go without water;
          <br> he described the situation later in his writings as "No peon, No Water".[7] He was required to sit on a gunny sack which
          <br>  he had to take home with him.[8]
